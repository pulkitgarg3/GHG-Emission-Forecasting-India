## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Stationarity checks and log transformation.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

2. **Structural Break Analysis:**
   - Ruptures library to detect significant policy or economic event impacts (e.g., LPG reforms in 1991).

3. **Volatility Modeling:**
   - Implemented ARCH, GARCH, and EGARCH models to study volatility clustering.

4. **Forecasting Models:**
   - SARIMAX integrated with EGARCH for robust forecasting.
   - Comparative analysis with other models like VAR, exponential smoothing, and AutoARIMA.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - RMSE, MAE, and AIC/BIC metrics used to compare model performances.

## ü§ñ Models Implemented

### 1. **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables):**
   - Captures seasonal trends and external influences.
   - Best model: SARIMAX(2, 0, 0) based on RMSE and AIC/BIC scores.

### 2. **GARCH/EGARCH:**
   - Modeled the conditional volatility in residuals.
   - Integrated EGARCH(1, 1) with SARIMAX for better accuracy.

### 3. **VAR (Vector Autoregression):**
   - Analyzed interdependencies between multiple time series.

### 4. **Exponential Smoothing:**
   - Simple and double exponential smoothing methods for trend analysis.

### 5. **ARIMA and AutoARIMA:**
   - Automated ARIMA modeling for baseline comparison.

## üîç Findings

1. Significant volatility spikes corresponded to major policy events, such as LPG reforms.
2. EGARCH(1, 1) captured volatility effectively and integrated well with SARIMAX.
3. SARIMAX(2, 0, 0) emerged as the most reliable forecasting model with the lowest RMSE.
4. Stationarity of the data was crucial for accurate model performance.

## üöÄ Future Scope

1. Explore deep learning models like LSTMs for long-term forecasting.
2. Conduct sector-wise analysis of emissions for targeted policymaking.
3. Build a user-friendly dashboard for real-time data visualization and prediction.
